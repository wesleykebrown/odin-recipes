    <h1>Seared Scallops With Basil Risotto</h1>
    <h4>Here's the ingredients needed to create this dish!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1½ cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup minced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1¼ cups uncooked Arborio rice</li>
        <li>¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper, plus more for seasoning</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 pound sea scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup microgreens, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Here are the steps to have this wonderful meal!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the pineapple juice and broth in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then cover with a lid and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a large saucepan set over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of the hot juice mixture to the saucepan and cook, stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed. Continue adding the hot liquid to the saucepan, one ladle at a time and stirring intermittently, until the rice is no longer crunchy, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper, then turn off the heat and stir in the basil. Set aside, covered, while you cook the scallops.</li>
        <li>Pat the scallops dry, then season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a medium skillet set over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add half the scallops and cook undisturbed for 2 minutes. Flip the scallops once, then tilt the skillet and baste them with the oil. Continue cooking the scallops an additional 1 minute, until no longer translucent. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining scallops, adding more oil as needed.</li>
        <li>Divide the risotto among serving plates and top with the scallops.</li>
        <li>Garnish with microgreens and serve.</li>
    </ol>
